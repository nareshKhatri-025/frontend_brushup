    <h1>What is Web Programming?</h1>
    <p>
      Web programming is a field of software development that focuses on
      creating applications for the <b>World Wide Web (WWW)</b> or the internet.
      It involves the use of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript, along with server-side technologies like PHP, Ruby on Rails,
      or Python to create dynamic and interactive websites and web applications.

      Web programming involves the development of both the front-end and
      back-end of a website. The front-end, also known as the client-side, is
      what the user sees and interacts with in their web browser. It is
      responsible for the look and feel of the website, and for implementing
      user-facing features like forms, navigation, and animations. The back-end,
      also known as the server-side, is responsible for managing the data and
      logic that powers the website. This includes tasks like storing and
      retrieving data from databases, processing user input, and delivering
      content to the front-end.

      Web programming is a rapidly growing field, and the demand for skilled web
      developers is high. With the rise of cloud computing and the internet of
      things, there is an increasing need for web developers who can build
      applications that are accessible and scalable, and can work seamlessly
      across different devices and platforms.
